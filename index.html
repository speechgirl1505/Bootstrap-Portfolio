                    This is the story of girl, who tried at coding and drowned in that world. That girl's name
                    is Kala
                    Elam, and that's me. At 32, for reasons we won't get into, I would assume a small stroke or
                    temporary loss
                    of sanity, the genius that I am decided to switch careers again, for the third time.
                    Which is how I found myself entering into the world of web development.
                    To say it is stressful and intimidating is a given, but it's also fun and thrilling and
                    rewarding.</p>
                    <p>Many moons ago, I graduated from Texas Christian University with my bachelors degree in
                        Speech Pathology and immediately started working as
                        a pediatric Speech Therapist. That same year I found yoga and felt joy for the first time in my
                        life, and
                        after two years of blood, sweat, pulled muscles, and some zen, I became a certified yoga
                        instructor.</p>
                    <p> It didn't take long for me to crave a new thrill in my life, and loving to travel, but
                        hating to fly, I
                        decided to become a Flight Attendant. I learned to love flying but knew that it was a temporary
                        hiatus from
                        real life, and bonus, avoiding the marriage and baby lectures from friends and family. After two
                        years in
                        the hedonistic airline industry, I knew it was time to leave with the shredded remains of my
                        soul.
                        And so
                        ends the tale of
                        how I ended up in the SMU web development bootcamp, trying to make my brain function again after
                        years of
                        sleeplessness and alcohol abuse.</p>
